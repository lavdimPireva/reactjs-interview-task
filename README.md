# Flex Business Solutions Tech Test - Notes app

In Flex Business Solutions, we aim to provide excellence and efficiency on all our lines of code in order to support the day-to-day activities of the company using our software solutions. In this task, you will be provided with a simple design of an app, fetching a list of products from an external source and allowing the user to search or filter among the list.


### Tech Test Overview
We have provided below the Figma link of this task. On the main page,

[FIGMA] [https://www.figma.com/file/T6hUVUDh5ihoYwQILcJDcf/React-Home-Test?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=lOTjaPb3chxGqXkY-1]

We love to see:
- Functional code
- Good design
- Unit testing


### Notes
All of you work should take place inside this repository.

You are free to use any packages that would help with this task

You do not need to add additional security measures as part of this exercise.
We're interested in how you break down the work and build your solution in a clean, easy-to-use, reusable and testable manner.


## Deliverables
You must follow the Figma design and need to add the functionality of:
a) Create new notes
c) Show all notes
b) Search notes

**Create a folder inside the repository and include finished screenshots of the app.**
**Please make sure to update the readme with**:

- How to run your app with all the necessary details
- Relating to the task please add answers to the following questions;
    1. How might you make this app more secure?
    2. How would you make this solution scale to millions of records?

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
